## Description

A Terraform module that provisions Amazon Route 53 DNS records and hosted zones into a unified, easy-to-use interface. Resolves resource ARNs and endpoints from dependent modules for automatic DNS wiring.

## Variable Naming

In all Cloud Solutions **components** and **modules**, we intentionally use the _map suffix for input variables that accept map(object(...)).

For example:
```hcl
variable "route53_map" {
  type        = map(object({ ... }))
  description = "Keyed collection of route53 definitions"
}
```
⚠️ This is a deliberate deviation from [Terraform Style Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/syntax/style).

We fully acknowledge that this naming convention does not follow the Terraform style guide, which recommends naming variables based on what they represent, not how they're implemented. We understand this, and want to emphasize:

1. This is a deliberate, informed decision, not an oversight.
2. Our primary goal is clarity and consistency for developers using our modules.
3. The intent is to give users immediate understanding of what kind of structure they're supplying.

### ✅ Why we made this decision (for our components and modules only)

This convention exists only within our components and modules structure. Here's why it works well for us:

1. Instant clarity for users - The _map suffix immediately signals that the variable supports multiple instances, each keyed by name. This avoids confusion around whether a variable is singular or plural.
2. Uniformity across all resources - Instead of struggling with awkward plurals (like kmses, rdses, vpcs, cloudfronts, account_managements) or inconsistent suffixes (_configs, _definitions, etc.), we use one simple, predictable pattern.
3. Avoids naming collisions - The _map suffix never conflicts with native Terraform or AWS resource types.
4. Future-proof for contributors - When contributors see _map, they can safely assume the structure is a map(object(...)) without checking variables.tf.

### 🙌 What this means for contributors

If you're contributing to Cloud Solutions components or modules, please:

1. Use the _map suffix when introducing a new map(object(...)) variable.
2. Follow the naming pattern consistently: rds_map, vpc_map, cloudfront_map, etc.
3. Don't apply this convention to Terraform projects outside components or modules - it's a local convention, not a global best practice.

If you have strong opinions or ideas for evolving this standard, you're welcome to open a discussion.

## Usage

```hcl
module "terraform-aws-route53-module" {
  source = "thecloudsolutions/terraform-aws-route53-module"
  # Cloud Solutions recommends to pin every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"

  # Required variables
  route53_map = {
    key = <value>
  }
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In our examples we don't pin modules to specific versions to keep the documentation aligned with the latest releases.
> However, for your own projects, we recommend to pin each module to the exact version you're using. This approach helps maintain the stability of your infrastructure.
> Additionally, adopting a structured process for version updates will help prevent unexpected changes.
